<h3>The Internet of Useless Things</h3>
	<p>There are strong divergences regarding the concept of Internet of
Things, and there is not a single and unanimous concept yet. In
general, it can be understood as an ecosystem of physical objects
interconnected with the Internet, through small and inbuilt
sensors, creating a ubiquitous computing environment. Although
it looks like a futuristic scenario, the Internet of Things is already a
reality. Every day, “things” connect to the Internet with the ability
to share, process, store, and analyze a huge amount of data
	between them.</p>
<p>It is necessary to reflect on the many products that have appeared
in the market, often decoupled from the character of real
usefulness and novelty, but still considered innovative
technologies only because they involve the digital aspect. This is
what has been called “The Internet of Useless Things”.
Digital technology does not necessarily make people’s lives easier,
and the costs of connecting a device are high and the benefits may
be too low to compensate for the increase in value in the product.
Often, a low-cost solution such as a shopping list, replacing the
innovative EggMinder, would be more convenient in cost-benefit
analysis, replacing an expensive device with complex
configurations and batteries that need recharge constantly. It does
	not sound so smart.</p>
<p>In addition, the amount of waste from disposing of obsolete
objects and devices, the so-called “e-waste”, is increasing
worldwide, because device connectivity tends to outpace them
faster than non-intelligent products. It is already considered a
	serious problem in some cities.</p>
<p>It is also important to keep in mind that turning an analog object
into an intelligent one, as well as making the product more

expensive and subject to flaws that it would not have a priori, can
also create risks in relation to security and privacy. Therefore, it is
important to think, from the perspective of the citizen as
consumer and of the State as an incentive for intellectual
creations, what kind of intelligent technologies and objects we
should encourage.

<h3>Internet of Useless Things Examples</h3>
<br>Some of the worst of the worst
<p>
	
<img src="a4group4/images/eggminder.jpg" alt="EggMinder" />
<a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/product/162b/
			 " target="_blank">Egg Minder</a>	
<br>A smart egg food tray. With the EggMinder you never have to look at a carton of eggs again! You can view how many eggs are in the
tray via an app, get notifications when eggs go bad or are close to going bad, get an alert when you are running low on eggs, 
and the tray lights up with LED lights letting you know which egg is the oldest. 
</p>
	  
<p>
<img src="a4group4/images/icon.jpg" alt="iCon" />
	<a href="https://britishcondoms.uk/icon-smart-condoms.html" target="_blank">iCon</a>
<br>A smart condom, that is actually not a condom, but a ring that will record everything from the speed of your thrusts, how many times
you have sex, average skin temperature, to the total duration of your sessions. This information can even be used to see how you
compare to other people around the world. Bluetooth is used to send the data from the ring to an app on your phone. 
</p>
		
<p>
<img src="a4group4/images/dashbuttons.jpg" alt="Amazon Dash Buttons" />
	<a href="https://www.amazon.com/ddb/learn-more
" target="_blank">Amazon Dash Buttons</a>
<br> Amazon dash buttons allow you to quickly order one particular item on Amazon’s app or website with the push of a button.
Seems great for essential items like laundry detergent or toilet paper but do you really need a button for say, Gillete razors or 
Trojan condoms?
</p>
	  
<p>
		<img src="a4group4/images/tweetpee.jpg" alt="Tweet Pee" />
			<a href="https://newatlas.com/huggies-tweetpee-signals-wet-diaper/27713/" target="_blank">Tweet Pee</a>
      <br> Huggies tested a contraption called TweetPee. A clipable device is attatched to a babies’ diaper and when the diaper has been soiled, the device tweets parents or caregivers that the baby needs changing. 
	</p>
		<p>
		<img src="a4group4/images/peggy.jpg" alt="Peggy" />
			<a href="http://www.omo.com/au/dirt-is-good/real-play/peggy.html" target="_blank">Peggy</a>
      <br> APeggy, from the company Omo, is the world’s first smart clothing peg. Peggy was created to help parents never miss an opportunity to spend quality time with their children. Peggy tracks your washing cycle and will send a push notification to let you know the exact amount of time your clothes should be dried. Peggy will also monitor the weather and give you the perfect time to start washing your clothes to avoid doing this chore when you could be playing with your kids.
